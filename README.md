wolfSSL Example Applications
============================

This repository contains example applications, written in C, which 
demonstrate how to use the wolfSSL lightweight SSL/TLS library for secure 
communication.

Each directory represents a unique topic (SSL/TLS, DTLS, PSK, etc.) and 
contains a Makefile as well as a simple tutorial on the given topic.

## Current Examples

#### clu (wolfSSL Command Line Utility)

This is a tool to provide command line access to wolfcrypt cryptographic libraries.
wolfSSL command line utility will allow users to encrypt or decrypt a user specified
file to any file name and extension.

Please see the README.md in clu/ for further usage and details.

###### Unique feature to wolfSSL CLU
The decision to allow for unique file extensions was prompted by automated tools
available for brute forcing files. It will not provide extra security cryptographically
however it will force attackers to check the header information on every single brute
force attempt. This will provide further frustration and an extra step in any attempt 
to brute force a file encrypted with our utility.

#### DTLS (Datagram TLS)

This directory contains examples of using DTLS, with client and server 
examples demonstrating UDP, DTLS, non-blocking, session resumption, 
and multi-threading.

When compiling wolfSSL for use with these examples, wolfSSL will need to be 
compiled with DTLS support:

```
cd wolfssl-[version]
./configure --enable-dtls
```

Examples in this directory may be compiled using:

```
cd ./dtls
make
```

#### PSK (Pre-Shared Keys)

This directory contains examples of using PSK, with client and server examples 
demonstrating TCP/IP, PSK, non-blocking, session resumption, and 
multi-threading.

When compiling wolfSSL for use with these examples, wolfSSL will need to be 
compiled with PSK support:

```
cd wolfssl-[version]
./configure --enable-psk
```

Examples in this directory may be compiled using:

```
cd ./dtls
make
```

#### SSL/TLS

This directory contains examples of using SSL/TLS, with client and server 
examples demonstrating TCP/IP, SSL/TLS, non-blocking, session resumption, and 
multi-threading.

Examples in this directory may be compiled using:

```
cd ./dtls
make
```

## Notes

When necessary, examples will use the example certificates and keys located 
in the ./certs directory. These certificates and keys have been pulled in from 
the main wolfSSL repository.
